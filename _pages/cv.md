Work experience
======
Digital Circuit Engineer｜Huawei company, Hisilicon department                     	12/2022 - Now
* Be responsible for the implementation of a submodule in Network chip SD8062V100, including ETH protocol transcoding, and architectural scheme.
* Serve as the Back End Support (BES) and the high-level block (HLB) owner for Optical module testament chip Diracv300, including clock and reset generation, High-speed SerDes interface adaptation, design constraint setting, HLB synthesis, and Synopsys Formality results analysis.
* Independently design a submodule in Network chip SD8026, including chip document writing (functional, architectural, and detailed design schemes), digital circuit conversion, and PPA (power, performance, and area) refinement. 


Project Experience 
======
Bachelor Graduation Design： Research of Speech Noise Reduction Based on Multi-source Vibration Signal Fusion 
* Use Matlab to simulate a simple multi-source de-noising system based on the LMS (Least Mean Square) algorithm. 
* Convert the LMS-based denoising system into the digital circuit and then implement it in FPGA. 

EE4690 Hardware Architecture for Artificial Intelligence Course Project 
* Use C++ to simulate the edge detector using the Sober operator. 
* Convert Sober-based edge detector into the digital circuit using HLS. 

ET4370 Reconfigurable Computing Design Course Project 
* Use Pytorch to build a simple image classifier with MNIST benchmark based on Binary Network (BNN). 
* Convert BNN-based image classifier into the digital circuit using Verilog. 

New control project in Europe
* Design a CDMA controller for the Harvard-architecture-based convolutional accelerator. 
* Design a Fetcher module to fetch different instructions from instruction sets, and then coordinate operations needed in the weight-stationary systolic array. 

Master Thesis Project： A New Logarithmic Quantization Technique and Corresponding Processing Element Design for CNN Accelerators 
* Software part: Propose a new quantization method named JLQ that performs well when the bit width of the 
operands becomes very small. 
* Hardware part: Develop a new Processing Element that can effectively implement Multiply-And-Accumulate 
(MAC) operations in convolution computation when the weights are JLQ-ed. 
* Resource utilization, area, and power consumption of the new PE both standing alone and with a real CNN 
accelerator are reported.
